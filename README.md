Design and Implementation of UART Using HDL

This repository contains the complete HDL-based implementation of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART). The design includes VHDL modules for the transmitter, receiver, and baud-rate generator, as well as auto-baud detection implemented in C. The architecture is modular, synthesizable, and suitable for FPGA platforms.

Overview

The UART developed in this project supports full-duplex serial communication and includes:

Baud-Rate Generator (BRG)

UART Transmitter

UART Receiver

Auto-Baud Detection (C Implementation)

Integrated UART Top Module

Complete Testbench with Simulation Output

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are used in both transmitter and receiver logic to ensure robust and reliable bit-level communication.
